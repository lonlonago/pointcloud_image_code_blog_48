 In Open3D, the common methods for building point cloud models are: [1] Open3D a-shape surface reconstruction [2] Open3D spherical rotation algorithm (BPA) 3D modeling [3] Open3D Poisson surface reconstruction

>  Since there is no point cloud model under watertight and orientable conditions for the time being, there is no computing volume. I will add it when there is a model!!! The code in another blog python - VTK computing the volume and surface area of the ply format mesh model does not require the point cloud model to be watertight and orientable.
