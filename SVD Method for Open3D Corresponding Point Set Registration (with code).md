##  2. Detailed process 

    It is known that the process of point cloud registration is to solve the rotation matrix and translation vector. Here, the objective function is: In the formula, it is the number of matching points, assuming that the least squares solution is sum, then it is the same as the centroid, that is, where: And the centroid of the point cloud is: Then make: At this time, the objective function can be rewritten as: will be decomposed into: 

  To make the minimum, it is necessary to derive and maximize, then there are: In the above formula, it is a third-order square matrix: the decomposition matrix is: let, then there is: This can be seen as a symmetric positive definite matrix. So for any third-order orthogonal square matrix, then for all third-order orthogonal square matrices, only when the determinant is close to 1 or equal to 1 (transformed so that it is completely coincident), the matrix is rotated. Then the translation matrix is:
